bagman (alpha)

### Overview
Assists you in lazy-loading and evaluation of your AMD Javascript modulesby simply
writing `<div data-foo-module="bar">` in your valid HTML5 code. Bagman will utilize an AMD loader to initialize the module and give you an instance for each occurance. Looks familiar? Onepager Frameworks such as Angular or Knockout also utilize this pattern (in a different way tho) to keep your code readable. Designed to work with Almond or RequireJS.
